				  <li><h1>Websites Under Construction Suck</h1>
				  	<h2>November 6th 2012</h2>
				  	<p>I have been quite busy over the last 2 months on the web development side of my business. I currently have 3  major websites on the go. This may not sound like a lot - but when you are a one man team, it's a bit to juggle. Especially when one of the websites is for my own brand.</p>
				  	<p>However, during this time, I must have thought about 1000 things to blog about. With subjects ranging from print design, to food, to fitness, to why I think that Tron:Legacy was an under rated film, I've always had ammunition for this blog. Getting to it done was the challenge.</p>
				  	<p>So when it came time to put the finishing touches to the Break Design website, I nearly glanced over the blog thinking "I can just put an under construction notice up there". However, on second thought, I realised this was a very bad idea. Through my time of constructing this website and many others, I have come to realise that people hate the words under construction. In my opinion, most people are very annoyed when they enter a website for a prospective supplier and see those 3 words. An under construction page is a recipe for the dreaded visitor bounce (whereas the visitor leaves within 15 seconds). Trust me, I have seen the analytics data to prove it.
				  	<p>So why do these 3 words mean certain doom for user retention? I personally believe that it comes down to brand presentation, and the reaction it can create. While surfing the net for that specific supplier or service, consumers are looking to find a business that they believe will provide a quality product and/or service. When they stumble upon a company with a well presented, usable website - they slow down a bit. This is what every business wants! Its only a little bit though. (Continued Next Page).</p>
				  </li>
				  <li><p> They slow down just enough to cruise through the products / services pages, so they can verify that this business is what they after. This still happens at lightning pace for most users - they can be in and out of site in under 3 minutes (most of the time). However, in the case of the "Under Construction" site, I believe the story is a lot shorter. When a user is presented with a dingy under construction page, I believe they have a strong adverse reaction. The brand presentation leads them to think very differently of the business. They are most likely to think "This business cannot get there website working - how can I trust their products / services?" or "Oh, they haven't been around long, I should go find someone who is more established". And then their gone! With a quick click of the back button, the customer is off to spend money at their competitor.</p><p> If I can recommend anything from my experience - do not put the words "Under Construction" on your site. So, what should you put on your site when the website is being built? Just don't mention that your site is still being built! Get a "splash page" or a "landing page" built. These are very easy and very cheap. The good ones usually consist of your logo, your services and your contact details - all wrapped up in a nice branded design.</p>
				  <p>Landing or Splash pages can also be quite creative. Some of my favourite examples can be found <a href="http://www.webdesigndev.com/inspiration/20-crazy-but-creative-website-splash-page-examples#" class="bloglinks" title="Examples">here</a> and <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/design-showcase-inspiration/25-beautiful-examples-of-coming-soon-pages/" class="bloglinks" title="Examples"> here</a> (ignore the ones with coming soon on them, thats just as bad)</p>
				  <p>If you are still having not in the right position to get your full website underway for your business, but are still interested in having something better than a "Under Construction" page, <a href="contact.html" title="Contact me!"> contact me</a> today to discuss what a cost effective landing page or splash page can do for your business.</p>
